# `Markdown styleguide`

Some rules to follow when writing Markdown for AMARO projects.

## Titles

- Always put one space between `#` and the text.

      # My awesome doc

## text

- Always separate titles from text with one new line. It increases readability without changing the way the markdown file is rendered.

      # My Awesome Doc

      Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.

## Formatting text

- Adopt `_` for italic and `*` for bold.

      This is an _italic_ word.
      This is a **bold** word.

## Lists

- Unordered lists should always use `-` as a standard. It helps differentiate from bold text.
- Ordered lists should always use the item number.

      - my
      - awesome
      - list
